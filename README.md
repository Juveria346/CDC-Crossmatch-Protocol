Wet lab protocol for transplant immunology using AHG-CDC assay
# CDC Crossmatch Assay – Protocol Summary

This repository documents the clinical and research protocol for performing the Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC) Crossmatch, a key test in transplant immunology used to detect the presence of preformed donor-specific antibodies.

## 🔬 Applications
- Pre-transplant histocompatibility testing
- Detection of T and B cell reactivity
- Evaluation of recipient serum cytotoxicity

## 🧪 Techniques Covered
- T and B cell isolation using RosetteSep
- Modified AHG-CDC crossmatch protocol
- Scoring using inverted phase contrast microscopy

## 📌 Notes
This protocol was followed and implemented during my internship at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, as part of transplant immunology diagnostics.
